# Debug Chat Detection

## 🔍 **How to Test Chat Detection**

### **Step 1: Run the Extension**
```bash
cd /Users/abdullahalamaan/Documents/Cursor.dev
./run-extension.sh
```

### **Step 2: Test Chat Detection**

1. **In the Extension Development Host window:**
   - Press `Cmd+L` to open Cursor's chat
   - Type a message like "Hello, can you help me?"
   - **Watch the console** for detection logs

2. **Look for these logs:**
   ```
   Document changed: [filename] [uri]
   User prompt pattern detected in: [filename] [uri]
   🎯 User prompt detected, waiting for agent to start...
   ```

3. **You should see a notification:**
   - "Learning Overlay: User prompt detected! Starting agent monitoring..."

### **Step 3: Test Different Chat Methods**

1. **Try Cursor's Chat (`Cmd+L`):**
   - Type: "Write a function that calculates fibonacci"
   - Should trigger detection

2. **Try Cursor's Composer (`Cmd+I`):**
   - Type: "Create a React component"
   - Should trigger detection

3. **Try typing in any file:**
   - Add comments like: `// Please help me with this code`
   - Should trigger detection

### **Step 4: Check Console Logs**

Look for these patterns in the console:
- `Active editor changed: [filename] [uri]`
- `Document changed: [filename] [uri]`
- `User prompt pattern detected in: [filename] [uri]`
- `🎯 User prompt detected, waiting for agent to start...`

## 🐛 **If Detection Doesn't Work**

1. **Check the console** for any error messages
2. **Try the manual test command:**
   - `Cmd+Shift+P` → "Learning: Simulate Agent (Test)"
3. **Check if Ollama is running:**
   - `ollama serve`
4. **Try typing in different places:**
   - Chat panel
   - Composer
   - Regular files with prompt comments

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior**

- ✅ **Console shows detection logs** when you type in chat
- ✅ **Notification appears** when prompt is detected
- ✅ **Learning overlay appears** after 2 seconds
- ✅ **Content rotates** every 30 seconds

If you see the detection logs but no overlay, the issue is with the overlay display, not the detection! 🚀
